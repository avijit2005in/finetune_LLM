Underwent angioembolisation
Post 6 cycles chemo, PET CT s/o stable disease
Received total 8 cycles Pacli + carbo till June 2021
PET CT (W/B) (19/7/21)- This scan was compared with patient's earlier study of May-21. Urinary bladder abnormality in left lateral wall is not appreciable now. Vault mass shows decrease in metabolic activity. Lymphnodes shows mild decrease inmetabolic activity. No new abnormality was noted.
Gynae onco opinion was sought in July 2021, ADV: No role of surgery- no role of surgery
Patient was started on Xeloda/endoxan from 7/7/21
Patient again had bleeding P/R and weight loss in Dec 2021
PET CT (22/12/21)- This scan was compared with patient's earlier study of July-21. Vault lesion shows decrease in extent and metabolic activity. No other significant interval changes and new abnormality was noted.
Patient kept on follow up, continued on concapsy

Ill-defined metabolically active soft tissue lesion is seen in vaginal vault on right side (2.9 x 2.3 cm, SUV max 14.7), abutting the right postero-lateral pelvic wall and right posterior wall of urinary bladder.Subcm lymphnodes are seen in mesenteric, aortocaval, paraaortic and bilateral inguinal regions with minimal heterogenous tracer uptake.This scan was compared with patient's earlier study of Dec. 21.

Metabolically active irregular soft tissue mass is seen in vaginal vaulton right side (approx. 4.6 x 3.8 cm, SUV max 22.7), abutting the right postero-lateral pelvic wall and right posterior wall of urinary bladder.

DOPA PET MRI OF BRAIN (20.04.2023) - Mildly DOPA avid, predominantly necrotic lesion with heterogeneous peripheral enhancement and measuring 1.7 x 1.0 cm (vs previous 1.4 x 0.9 cm (04/03/23) vs 1.3 x 0.8 cm (31/01/23)] is seen in the post op bed-in the operated bed in the right frontoparietal region. (SUV max 2.23 with lesion/striatum ratio of 0.83: vs threshold of >1.0).
The lesion shows focal areas of diffusion restriction with no increased perfusion (CBV 1.6 vs 2.5 as threshold), and no significant increased choline on MRS (Cho/ Cr & Cho/NAA ratio of 1.42 & 1.27 In addition, few nodular enhancing foci with interspersed susceptibility changes are seen in the respectively). adjoining parenchyma with mild associated oedema.
Compared to previous studies dated 04/03/23 and 31/01/23, there is no significant change in the size & extent of enhancing lesions and perilesional oedema.
A tiny residual pin head size enhancing focus is seen in the right cerebellum at the site of previously visualised lesion and remains regressed from previous study dated 31/01/23
