COPD, aspiration
NSCLC - Adenocarcinoma(EGFR/ALK/ ROS negative)
- Presented with complainst of Breathlessness on Exertion and Low Grade Fever (off & on)
- PET-CT: Right Lower Lobe Mass (7.3 cm) with Mediastinal Invasion (Type A), encasing LMB. N2 nodal distribution.
- MRI Brain: No Brain Metastases
- PFT (RGCI): Severely reduced DLCO
Impression: In view of poor pulmonary function and consequently risk of RT pneumonitis, upfront definitive RT is not feasible.
Barium swallow (24.08.2021):Significant aspiration is noted with opacification of the trachea and B/L bronchioles.
RT insertion was done on 25.08.2021
started on-weekly pacli carbo day1 day 8 q 3 weekly from 14 july 2021 till sep 2021- 4 cycles
pet ct- Good partial response to treatment with persistent residual metabolically active right lung mass (withextensions), mediastinal lymphadenopathy and right pleural effusion as described
in between has required RT insertion for management of dysphagia,
msc discussion- to go ahead with CTRT

Now the patient was referred to us for USG guided core FNAC from Right supra-clavicular LN.The procedure has been explained in detail to the patient and her attendants.
Screening USG done: No right supra-clavicular LNs seen. A sub-cm sized left supra-clavicular LN noted. Otherwise, few small nodules noted in thyroid gland.
Therefore, it was decided to do the FNAC from left supra-clavicular LN.
After informed consent, Under all aseptic conditions and LA, USG guided FNAC (non-aspiration) done from left supra-clavicular LN. Two passes made.
4 slides for AD and 3 slides for PAP sent for cytological examination.

.IMPRESSION: present study reveals a thick walled irregular cavity with solid component and aheterogeneously enhancing infrahilar lesion involving the right lower lobe bronchus with extensionsand involvements and other findings as described.
Metabolically active soft tissue mass lesion is noted along right suprahilar region of right lung (4.5x-3.7cm,SUV max 15.2), encasing adjoining bronchus, abutting adjoining mediastinal soft tissue structure.Another mild metabolically active cavitatory lesion with solid component (3.8 x 3.3cm, SUV max 5.8) isabutting the right hilar mass.Few metabolically inactive subcm size pulmonary nodules are seen in right upper lobe of lung.
